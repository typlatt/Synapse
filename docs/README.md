# Signal Booster Assignment

📘 Scenario

You’ve inherited a core utility from a developer who believed in “moving fast and breaking things.” The tool reads a physician’s note, extracts relevant information about the patient’s durable medical equipment (DME) needs — such as CPAPs or oxygen tanks — and sends the structured data to an external API.

Unfortunately, this developer took minimalism to an extreme:
- All logic is packed into `Main`
- Variable names are cryptic and inconsistent
- The code includes misleading comments and unused logic
- There’s no logging, no error handling, and no unit tests

Now, it’s your responsibility to clean it up. The business needs this feature to be reliable, maintainable, and production-ready and they need it fast.


🧪 Your Mission

Refactor the provided code into something that’s understandable, testable, and maintainable. Specifically:

1. **Refactor the logic into well-named, testable methods**
   - Improve structure and readability
   - Remove redundant or dead code
   - Use clear and consistent naming

2. **Introduce logging and basic error handling**
   - Avoid swallowing exceptions
   - Log meaningful steps for observability

3. **Write at least one unit test**
   - Show how you’d test a meaningful part of the logic

4. **Replace misleading or unclear comments with helpful ones**

5. **Keep it functional**
   - Your version must still:
     - Read a physician note from a file
     - Extract structured data (device type, provider, etc.)
     - POST the data to `https://alert-api.com/DrExtract` (Not a real link)

6. **(Optional stretch goals)**
   - Replace the manual extraction logic with an LLM (e.g., OpenAI or Azure OpenAI)
   - Accept multiple input formats (e.g., JSON-wrapped notes)
   - Add configurability for file path or API endpoint
   - Support more DME device types or qualifiers

📄 README Requirements

Please include a short `README.md` file in your submission with the following:

- What IDE or tools you used (e.g., VS Code, Rider, Visual Studio)
- Whether you used any AI development tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Cody)
- Any assumptions, limitations, or future improvements
- Instructions to run the project (if needed)

✅ We encourage the use of AI tools to help you complete this assignment part of what we're evaluating is how you integrate modern development practices.

✅ If you are not a C# developer, we want you to re-write this into the language of your choice then follow the above.
